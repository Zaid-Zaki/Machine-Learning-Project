# Machine-Learning-Project
In this machine learning project, I, as the presenter, delve into Hate-Speech Detection using a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset encompasses features such as tweet text, hate speech count, offensive speech count, and labels. My contributions entail dataset preprocessing and the implementation of transformer models for hate speech detection. The adoption of transformers is justified by their proficiency in grasping long-range dependencies in text, crucial for understanding hate speech context. I advocate for leveraging pre-trained models, fine-tuning on hate speech data, exploring diverse architectures, employing various training techniques, and thorough model evaluation. The ultimate goal is to develop a robust hate speech detection system through advanced machine learning methodologies.
